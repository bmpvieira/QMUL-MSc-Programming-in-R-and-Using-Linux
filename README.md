# MSc practicals: Programming in R and using Unix

This is part of QMUL's SBCM032 Statistics & Bioinformatics MSc-level course. 

For each year, we include a series of practicals that teach the basics of programming (in R) and the basics of unix. The R practicals include the teaching of regex, functions, loops and if statements. The R practicals are generally based on the BSc programming course, which generally happens before the MSc course.
